/**
Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is `to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others`. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

`!`` Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a `real IQ test`, which means indexes of the elements start from `1 (not 0)`

Examples :
```
iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd
```
**/

function iqTest(numbers){
  const odd_nums = []
  const even_nums = []

  for (let [index, value] of numbers.split(' ').entries()) {
    if (value % 2 !== 0) {
      even_nums.push(index);
    } else {
      odd_nums.push(index);
    }
  }

  return (odd_nums.length === 1) ? odd_nums[0] + 1 : even_nums[0] + 1;
}
