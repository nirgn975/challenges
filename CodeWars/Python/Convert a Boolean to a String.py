"""
In this programming exercise, you're going to learn about functions, boolean (true/false) values, strings, and the if-statement.

A function is a block of code that takes an input and produces an output. In this example, `boolean_to_string` is a function whose input is either true or false, and whose output is the string representation of the input, either "true" or "false".

A common idea we often want to represent in code is the concept of true and false. A variable that can either be true or false is called a boolean variable. In this example, the input to `boolean_to_string` (represented by the variable `b`) is a boolean.

Lastly, when we want to take one action if a boolean is true, and another if it is false, we use an if-statement.

For this kata, don't worry about edge cases like where unexpected input is passed to the function. You'll get to worry about these enough in later exercises.
