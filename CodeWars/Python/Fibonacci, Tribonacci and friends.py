If you have completed the Tribonacci sequence kata, you would know by now that mister Fibonacci has at least a bigger brother. If not, give it a quick look to get how things work.

Well, time to expand the family a little more: think of a Quadribonacci starting with a signature of 4 elements and each following element is the sum of the 4 previous, a Pentabonacci (well Cinquebonacci would probably sound a bit more italian, but it would also sound really awful) with a signature of 5 elements and each following element is the sum of the 5 previous, and so on.

Well, guess what? You have to build a Xbonacci function that takes a signature of X elements - and remember each next element is the sum of the last X elements - and returns the first n elements of the so seeded sequence.

```
Xbonacci([1,1,1,1],10)==[1,1,1,1,4,7,13,25,49,94]
Xbonacci([0,0,0,0,1],10)==[0,0,0,0,1,1,2,4,8,16]
Xbonacci([1,0,0,0,0,0,1],10)==[1,0,0,0,0,0,1,2,3,6]
```

def Xbonacci(signature,n):
    result = signature[:]

    for x in range(n-len(signature)):
        current_fib = 0
        start = len(result) - len(signature)
        for y in result[start:]:
            current_fib += y
        result.append(current_fib)

    return result[:n]
